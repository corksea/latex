Notes while creating the Corrected Edition of Precalculus Version 3.  All page numbers and Section numbers refer to Version 3, dated July 15, 2011.

On p.52 in Section 1.3 I have a note by exercise 48 which says 'Enhance or add more' and a note by 49 which says 'reword'.  Why?

On p.53 in Section 1.3 we don't use the letters for number sets that we introduce in 1.1.  Why not?

On p.56 in Section 1.4 I have a note by Example 1.4.2 that says 'different'.  Why?

On p.61 in Section 1.4 I have a note by Example 1.4.4 that says 'Get a new one.'  Why?

Should piecewise defined functions have commas after the function definition before the 'if'?

On p.118 I have a note to check the consistency of how we present local maxs/mins.  Let's not forget about this kind of isue.

On p.164 I say that Exercise 36 should be moved to the end.  Why?

On p.189 in Section 2.3 there is nothing written by the arrows.  I think we should 'embed' and exercise for the students to find the graphs of the intermediate steps.

On p.201 in Section 2.3 I have a note to 'rethink' Exercise 22.  Why?

Add 'unusual steepness' to the graph on p.241

p.242 and 244 Align the graphs!!

p.930 formatting of the points needs to reflect the (a), (b), (c) of the question

p.932 the point satisfies part (a) but we don't mention that







General overall concerns:

When should the word 'mathematics' be capitalized?
